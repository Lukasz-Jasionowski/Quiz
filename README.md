# Quiz

The project is a simple quiz that consists of 3 additional pages besides the home page, namely game, end, and highscore.  
In the project, visual effects have been implemented to highlight buttons for correct and incorrect answers.  
Additionally, points and the current question number are displayed in real-time, along with a progress bar.  
After completing the quiz, the user has the option to save their score, start a new game, or return to the home page.  
From the home page, the user can also access the High Scores page, where scores are saved if the user chooses to do so.
